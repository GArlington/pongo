#Guidelines for designing the Emfatic model of your Pongos

= Break down big objects into multiple collections =

Each Pongo cannot be larger than 16MB (Mongo's restriction). Bear that in mind when you're designing the break-down of your objects and use multiple collections and non-containment references instead.

For example instead of keeping all the contents of a blog in one document:

{{{
@collection
class Blog {
  val Post[*] posts;
}

class Post {
  ...
}
}}}

you should consider using 2 collections and a non-containment reference (ref instead of val) instead:

{{{
@collection
class Blog {
  ref Post[*] posts;
}

@collection
class Post {

}
}}}

Of course then you'll need to do a bit of house-keeping manually (i.e. delete all Posts when a Blog is deleted) but this shouldn't be that hard.

= Data types supported =

The following primitive data types are supported for your attrs

  * int
  * String
